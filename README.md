# Data-Analysis-Dashboard
I developed comprehensive Data analysis project using Power BI, creating Multiple Interactive dashboards and tables to analyze the Dynamic data. I built a dynamic Power BI dashboard that provides real-time insights into office presence, work-from-home (WFH), and sick leave (SL%) trends.This process involved several stages, including data preprocessing, data cleaning, and data visualization.
