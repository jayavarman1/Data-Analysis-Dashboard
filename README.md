# Office-Attendance-Analysis(Interactive Dashboard creation using Power Bi)

## 🚀 Project Overview

I developed a comprehensive Data analysis project using Power BI, creating Interactive dashboards and tables to analyze the Dynamic data. I built a dynamic Power BI dashboard that provides real-time insights into office presence, work-from-home (WFH), and sick leave (SL%) trends. This process involved several stages, including data preprocessing, data cleaning, and data visualization.
